## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Query

### What I learned

For a long time, I used toget bothered by the "position" properties in CSS. This project used them a lot of times and it helped me becoming familier with all of them. I got to understand many other CSS properties while completing this project.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - I asked it wherever I was not able to understand something.
